        <p>My name is Austin DeBoer, I am a husband, father, an aspiring teacher, and a maker. I first met my wife when I was 19 years old, when I was still enrolled into Ferris State Universityâ€™s Digital Animation and Game Design major with an emphasis in programming. I was also working for a local die cast manufacturer, Brillcast. After two and a half years of dating my current wife we got married in the year 2014. </p>
        <p>In the year 2016 I found out that I was going to be a dad. On June 16th, 2017 my daughter Selah was born (pictured to the right). She is now two years old and she is super energetic and fun to be around. She enjoys swimming, playing with our dog Posie, going down slides, playing with her toy dinosaurs, and playing with her small house set we got her recently. We also have a boy on the way that will be born in December of this year. </p>
        <p>After deciding that I did not choose to pursue a career in game development I chose to apply to Grand Valley to become a teacher for high school students in both Math and Computer Science. I have been pursuing this path for the past three years and start my student teaching in the Winter 2020 semester. I am very excited to start this part of my schooling adventure and come one step closer to graduation. </p>
        <p>I call myself a maker because many of my hobbies include making things. I enjoy woodworking, 3d modeling, using my 3d printer, paint miniatures, and recently I have been exploring making my own dice. </p>

        <p>Jon Sandman is my inspiration. He is a self made YouTuber that started making videos in 2014. Since then he has aquired 275 million views with currently 946,443 subscribers. He is not always the best at the games he plays, but he is funny and always has a great attitude. This is how I think we should approch every situation, good or bad, with a great attitude.</p>
